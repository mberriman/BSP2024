# WormBase ParaSite workshop
At the British Society for Parasitology Spring Meeting, 2nd April 2024, University of Liverpool

## Course Overview
[Wormbase Parasite](https://parasite.wormbase.org/) was established in 2014 as a sister resource to [WormBase](https://www.wormbase.org/), the curated model organism database centred around C. elegans. The goal was to enable researchers working on parasitic helminths to explore and interrogate the explosion of new draft genomes, and accelerate basic and applied helminth research.

The purpose of this workshop is to introduce you to WormBase ParaSite.  In the first part of the workshops, we’ll walk you through what the resource is and how you can use it to:

- Find genomes and evaluate their quality,
- Access individual genes and explore associated information on their functions
- Query the database to obtain customised downloads

After a break, well explore some of the key tool in WormBase ParaSite, including 
- BLAST,
- The genome browsers,
- The Variant Effect Predictor,
- Analysis of gene expression data, 
- Gene-set enrichment analysis.

If we have time, we’ll also talk about ways in which you can get involved in helping to improve helminth genomics resources!
